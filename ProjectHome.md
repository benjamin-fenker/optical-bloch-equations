This highly specialized code numerically calculates the time evolution of the quantum mechanical density matrix for optical pumping calculations as given in Tremblay and Jacqes PRA 41 (9) 1990 4989-4999.  The code is intended for no other application.  Motivation for this project is to create a better theoretical model of optical pumping as it pertains to measurement of asymmetry parameters in the beta-decay of 37K.
